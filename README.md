Food Ordering App

Food Ordering App, my project involves building a user-friendly application using ReactJS, inspired by platforms like Swiggy.
The app incorporates essential features such as a seamless ordering system, a dynamic cart feature, and a visually appealing interface.
Users can browse through a variety of restaurants and cuisines, add items to their cart, and proceed with the ordering process.
The ReactJS framework is leveraged for efficient component-based development, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience.
The cart feature allows users to review and modify their orders before finalizing.
